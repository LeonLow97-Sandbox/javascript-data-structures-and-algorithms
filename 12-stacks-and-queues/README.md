# Stacks

- [Stacks Slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/stacks)

## Objectives

- Define what a stack is
- Understand use cases for a stack
- Implement operations on a stack data structure

## What is a stack?

- A LIFO data structure (where the last value in is always the first one out)
- The last element added to the stack will be the first element to be removed from the stack.
- E.g., _Call Stack_

## Where stacks are used

- Managing function invocations
- Undo/redo e.g., photo-shopping
- Routing (the history object - frontend) is treated like a stack

## Implementing a stack

- There is more than 1 way of implementing a stack.
- _Array_ Implementation
  - `.push()` and `.pop()`
    - better option: does not require re-indexing.
  - `.unshift()` and `.shift()`
    - might not be good to use this because adding to the beginning of an array is O(N)
    - have to re-index every element.
  - using array to implement a stack might not be efficient, use linked list instead
- _Linked List_ Implementation
  - `stack.push()` and `stack.pop()`

### `Pushing` PseudoCode

- `push` to the beginning of the linked list.
- Similar to SLL unshift
  - Did not use SLL push and pop because pop requires us to traverse through the entire linked list as this is done at the end of the linked list.
- The function should accept a value.
- Create a new node with that value
- If there are no nodes in the stack, set the first and last property to be the newly created node.
- If there is at least 1 node, create a variable that stores the current first property on the stack.
- Reset the first property to be the newly created node
- Set the next property on the node to be the previously created variable.
- Increment the size of the stack by 1.

### `Pop` PseudoCode

- `pop` remove from the beginning
- If there are no nodes in the stack, return null.
- Create a temporary variable to store the first property on the stack.
- If there is only 1 node, set the first and last property to be null.
- If there is more than 1 node, set the first property to be the next property on the current first.
- Decrement the size by 1.
- Return the value of the node removed.

## Big O of Stacks

| Insertion | Removal | Searching | Access |
